the only thing i don 't like about it is that you have to buy a larger memory card , first thing ! .	0
they fix the problem and help you with whatever your i-pod needs comes with two usb ports and a charger .	1
they have the worst service of any of the major companies .	0
the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it .	1
anyhow , this software is working fine and no problems since i installed it two weeks ago .	1
the battery is nice .	1
the 6600 ( t-mobile ) is the true 'world phone ' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe , including new zealand and australia ( 900 ) whereas the 6620 ( available from singular ) replaces it w/ 800mhz ( some refer to as 850 ) .	1
the edge guide is top quality , easy to install and accurate .	1
the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .	1
i highly recommend this phone to anyone .	1
this is not an enterprise piece of hardware that you will find in an office or corporate environment .	0
i find this to be a great feature .	1
i also own a retail store and this little guy easily plugs into my aux slot in the store 's sound system .	1
for the zen creative focused on packaging which looked well thought out , well presented and easy to open and put back together .	1
however after playing with it for three weeks now , i 'm convinced , the zen micro is superior .	1
it 's as though nokia has segregated 90 % of the screen for fancy features rarely used and leave just 10 % for the day to day use .	0
i 'm probably the only person that dislikes the itunes software .	0
it all sounds great too .	1
i 've had almost no problems with the firmware ( ie , lock-ups , shut-downs etc ) , but i have kept the player up to date .	1
it holds a lot of diapers , not to mention the odor ! .	1
the battery issue is superficially a concern , but any reasonable solder-jockey ( such as myself : - ) can pop in a new one when the time comes ( based upon the plentiful info gained from a go ogle for 'ipod battery replacement ' ) .	0
it holds plenty of songs .	1
the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers .	1
. this camera keeps on outfoxing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped .	0
i highly recommend this ! .	1
with the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn , it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones .	1
1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its program and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n 't want to bother with the settings .	1
the software that comes with the digital elph is very nice and intuitive .	1
first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good . . .	1
speaker volume is loud and clear but it sacrifices the battery life .	0
the only problem is the battery life .	0
the blue backlit lcd looks really neat and is easy to read .	1
- the outlook syn ch only works for non recurring appointments , which personally is very annoying to me but probably wont be to most people . -	0
i love it ! . ! .	1
start up , log off , log on . . . everything became very slow .	0
while transferring songs to the player , the interface has crashed a few times ( 4-5 times in a 4-5 hour period ) normally this would cause me major concern , but it appears that this bug is reproducible , which leads me to believe that creative will fix it with a patched version shortly ( or maybe it 's just my computer ) .	0
it 's easy .	1
i went out and got the canon today .	1
the power is incredible , it cut through md and plywood like butter .	1
anyhow some demerits of this phone , the phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most nokia variants .	0
this is a great product , and canon has done an excellent job .	1
it wouldn 't always work seamlessly with wmp and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it .	0
its just as fast as the included creative software , but much less invasive , and overall better looking .	1
before you run out and buy an ipod , understand something : there are reasons the zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle , principally excellent ( for mp3 ) sound quality .	1
but , i am quite unhappy with nokia at the moment .	0
i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again .	0
i still can 't believe how fast it starts up .	1
has a great helpline .	1
the creative mediasource software that comes with the zen micro is cluttered , and excludes my favorite feature in itunes , the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder .	0
1 ) a spare battery would have been great .	0
the battery , as others have said , also seems weaker than creative suggests .	0
- uploading music is quick and easy .	1
there was neither picture nor sound .	0
a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging -- - how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )	1
transferring files couldn 't be easier thanks to the included software bundle .	1
i had the second one for less than two weeks when i noticed a rattling/humming/buzzing sound while music was played .	0
it 's such a great camera ! . i think it really was worth the investment = )	1
unfortunately , it does not give you the option of installing ( or installing ) them individually .	0
i also had no problems installing or running the camera software on my pc .	1
the flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent .	1
2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .	0
i really have no complaints over this unit .	1
this is an excellent router for the money .	1
as for itunes , i don 't find it to be as good as the windows media player as a computer mp3 player , but it is good enough .	1
best of all the wmas ( i have a lot of them ) sound great .	1
nokia was my first non flip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them .	1
video output stopped working .	0
i would recommend this product to anyone .	1
now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will ! .	0
they have a good concept here , and i normally expect a lot better quality from creative , so maybe they will do better with the next gen version , but for now i say buyer beware .	0
there are instructions to encrypt your personal wireless network so no one else can end up hogging/stealing your bandwidth .	1
the creative zen micro is a zen micro killer , not an ipod killer .	0
for more than a year , and it is totally reliable .	1
speaker phone quality is good , and poping in a 512mb mmc card , it rocks ! .	1
neither message was answered ( they ask for 24 hours before replying - i 've been waiting 27 days . )	0
6- small but very clear tft screen .	1
solid , squeak-free , large screen .	1
a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .	1
the grain was terrible .	0
it plays everything , even vcd 's .	1
this camera has canon 's great calorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get .	1
i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least .	1
software - the software is crap .	0
after comparing the included creative earbuds directly against my sony md-e828lp 's and sennheiser mx-400 's , i find myself still using the creative 's , which in my opinion , sound every bit as good and have a slightly longer cord .	1
the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .	1
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to .	1
all you have to do is click one button on the router configuration window and the router automatically senses the devices and configures the network .	1
it beats apple on the storage space , it beats apple on the removable battery ( and batter life ) , and i personally like its interface more than the ipod scroll wheel .	1
creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean .	1
because steve jobs is a twisted individual and he made sure that he ruined this device by giving it an unrepeatable 18 month battery .	0
once it froze so bad i couldn 't even use the power button to turn it off , and had to open and take out the battery .	0
all in all suprisingly easy to use .	1
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disappointed ! .	0
i highly recommend it .	1
creative did well on its rechargeable battery feature . .	1
the disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures , especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can .	0
i will never use all the `` whistles and bells `` this machine is capable of .	1
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd-rs fill of files ( e . , mp3s ) .	1
maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .	0
playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists .	1
in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great ! .	1
3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .	0
canon 's g3 does it consistently .	0
that 's it for now , what are you doing still reading this , click the `` add to cart `` button already ! .	1
what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .	0
the new hardware version does not run linux at all and most likely will not since the memory has been cut in half .	0
no in box accessories -- an arm strap , belt strap , case , or anything would be nice , but nope . . . moveable parts -- this makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th ; . with moveable parts , its easy to damage an ipod at a gym , so this is for more casual listeners ; . note the ipod mini doesn 't have moveable parts and is made of titanium .	0
because this camera is beautiful .	1
but not good enough for me .	0
i tried called apex cu st service , no help .	0
the colors are a joke , and i personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad .	0
with the automatic settings , i really have n 't taken a bad picture yet .	1
you can use it as a storage hard drive .	1
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them .	1
the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n 't take up space on your pc hard drive .	1
i didnt get ipod because i dont especially like itunes ( no music i want , but thats just me ) and the creative product was cheaper ; . and i needed to be able to use wma files .	1
it 's too bad , though , that ! .	0
- great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price	1
very sleek & stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has .	1
high quality video and pictures rock ! .	1
i 'm in high school , and this camera is perfect for what i use it for , carrying it around in my pocket so i can take pictures whenever i want to , of my friends and of funny things that happen .	1
the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .	1
even after all the nightmare sound problems , i 'd still half-way like this product if it kept it 's promise ; . the ability to store 1500 songs .	0
for some this might be a problem , but for the price of a 30 gig ipod , you can get a 60gb nomad , the ipod simply pales in comparison .	1
the player 's software is very easy to use and very good .	1
easy enough to navigate through , although i 'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumb wheel scroll / push button .	1
i 've had it for a week now , do n 't regret the purchase one bit , and i never leave home without it .	1
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n 't like it too but no harm done since i always use the cam ea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n 't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; . that is what lamest exactly ot the picture .	0
you can take pic of your friends and the picture will pop up when they call .	1
- the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones .	0
i am now staring at an array of stuff including zen micro player , stereo earbud headphones , a rechargeable lithium-ion battery , an ac/dc power adapter , a usb 2 . 0 cable , a belt-clip , a stand , a stylish cloth pouch , an installation cd , a quick-start guide , and creative mediasource software .	1
longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities .	1
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me , however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate .	1
transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1 . 1 or 2 . 0 .	0
also , some other mp3 players such as the nitrus allow you to play wma ( windows media audio ) files , whereas the ipod does not .	0
first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod .	1
the battery is removable .	1
*holds the odor in nicely ! .	1
p . s . the only snag i encountered while initially configuring the device was trying to hook up the micro to a front usb port . the bus for the front port on my motherboard did not have enough power ; . after connecting it to the rear ports , it works perfectly .	0
limitations : - not a lot of original accessories like the ipod .	0
*holds a lot of diapers -- a full week of toddler diapers ! .	1
the prints are beautiful ! .	1
but i had to give you four because the service for my brand-new ipod was terribly slow .	0
but , the creative zen micro is plagued by a serious , serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw , and i 'm going to tell you what it is . . . but first , two more things about this piece of garbage that 's so great and could 've made it a potential ipod killer .	0
i use the same store-brand tall kitchen trash bags i already use in the kitchen for it -- no special `` diaper `` trash bags necessary .	1
nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price .	1
still , that 's enough time that i 'm still satisfied , if a bit grouchy with creative 's over hyped promises .	0
it has the odd side effect of the buttons only partially working ? .	0
i use a nokia 6600 , it has a great color tft display and camera equipped with zoom , which complement a built-in video recorder with audio and a real one player for playback and streaming of 3gpp-compatible and real media video clips .	1
fyi , battery doesn 't die if you don 't use lcd	1
3 ) user replaceable battery	1
i think it is a combination of the program size taking up resources and the open/close scanning that it does with every program .	0
i can 't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good .	0
first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod .	1
this camera uses a lithium battery , i find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient ; . because what if you are on vacation , where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station -- there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there .	0
this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images .	1
i like the auto fit feature = you can stretch wide screen dvd 's to normal .	1
the battery is also convenient , but could have been better , such as the zen touch 's battery ( but at least this one is removable ) .	1
it offers way more features than i need but the ones i use work well .	1
the computer interface is 90 % good , only losing points due to the fact that `` creative `` branding is all over the place within it .	1
i love this camera ! .	1
the games are decent , but u only get 2 to start off with .	1
the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; . you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! . ) .	0
i did n 't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase ! .	1
second , the setup cd actually worked perfectly .	1
nothing spectacular is done by internet security or by antivirus software .	0
but canon never fails to amaze .	1
the only beef that i have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged .	0
the dynamic playlists ( `` now playing `` , i be live creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate . . .	0
i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n 't play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message ) .	0
big lcd screen - at least for me , 2 `` is enough	1
this phone is one of the best i 've ever used .	1
interface - practically seamless .	1
it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx .	1
their site offers no live help at all .	0
now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 ! .	0
service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great .	1
by no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it , just be able to put a cd in the computer and it tells you what to do .	1
file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2 . 0 .	1
i downloaded a trial version of computer associates ex firewall and antivirus and fell in love with a computer security system all over again .	1
well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze .	0
creative software stinks .	0
this process can be very annoying and unsafe when you are driving a stick shift on the highway .	0
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .	1
it would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die .	0
the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices .	1
so far , the anti-spam feature seems to be very good .	1
i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards .	1
for the money apex machines have good features .	1
i have had no problems with the phone .	1
the fact that the `` 0 `` key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the `` # `` key instead .	0
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement .	1
this camera is great , wonderfully small , and has attractive hi-tech casing .	1
the touch controls took a little getting used to but now i wouldn 't change it for the scroll wheel .	0
the battery does not last 12 hours .	0
it powers up quickly , so you won 't miss that quick shot .	1
after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace , i decided on the s100 .	1
is not as intuitive as i would like .	0
. lens cap is a really annoying	0
the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject .	1
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb .	0
however , configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than 3 hours , and briefly made me reconsider my choice to for ego the airport and its notoriously easy setup .	0
i also put a bend in the wrench so i can remove and install bits from the top of the table .	0
the only problem i had was a few components didn 't quite load correctly upon startup , but a reboot fixed the problem .	0
when i purchase software , i never want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems -- in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry ! .	0
i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .	1
second , the `` automatic `` sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer .	1
it is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great .	1
the machine itself seems fine , but the software that came with it is awful .	0
i have less money invested in the router table and dual routers than i would have if i had purchased a single cheap reliant sharper .	1
built like a tank , yet nimble enough to be comfortably used with the leigh dovetail jig .	1
it 's not my first choice in cameras ,	0
sending the unit to the company of purchase which costs about $ 90 ) , the ability to record with a built-in microphone ( great for recording reminders and meetings ) , very sturdy construction , and not to mention . . . the sound quality is excellent ! .	1
all i have to say is that the pics i get with my sd500 are both rich and color and high in detail , the user interface is awesome , the battery charger is tiny and super light and sd cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time .	1
the phone is very light weight .	1
even when i set it to low , it 's still very hard for me to adjust the player to where and what i want it to do .	0
seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) .	1
the dvd player is fine .	1
the plusses are the features , look , good signal and battery life , memory size and robustness .	1
the sound quality is excellent , accessing the music is easy , and the controls are generally well thought out .	1
i have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright .	1
it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted .	1
those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .	1
the included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well .	1
its compact and has rounded edges .	1
i 've had no problems w/ this phone .	1
well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket .	1
i purchased two of these beauties .	1
i love that you can create custom playlists , and organize music in so many different ways .	1
they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality .	1
the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n 't come in the overused blue .	0
i did have to cut off the ears that hold the template guide in place so i could get those big panel raising bits in it .	0
when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n 't there :	0
first thing i noticed was that the creative wasn 't well made .	0
stay away from this product ! .	0
- speakerphone	1
it feels like i 'm back to the days of 56k dial-up internet service , even though i 'm running a dell 2ghz pentium 4 with 256mb memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year .	0
i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players .	1
i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class .	1
it feels solid and not flimsy like the carbon .	1
these people takes lest effort to process rebate forms .	0
creative has excellent music software , a very responsive tech support group ( they are quick on firmware updates , and make them publicly available ) , and usually a good array of accessories .	1
i never get dropped calls .	1
it took several days of attempts before things finally `` worked `` again and i have n 't a clue why .	0
the sound is bright and clear , the ability to store any mp3 's ( and not just apple-approved files ) is great , and i plan to make use of the storage space and sound recording from time to time .	1
the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .	0
exposure compensation in 1/3 stop increments ( i leave it set on +1/3 stop to brighten up the default exposure , which goes a bit dark for my taste ) .	1
i own this phone for about 6 months now , i have used the following features : bluetooth connection to laptop and desktop for sync contacts and calendars with outlook , transfer files ( movies , songs ) , i have many movies on it now with a 512mb memory card that it takes .	1
this is the mp3 player with everything i need . as long as it lasts me a good three years , i 'm satisfied .	1
there is also no voice recording , something most if not all mp3 players have that the ipod doesn 't .	0
this is definitely one of those products , especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit .	0
i purchased this over the ipod mini because it had several nice features : extra 1g storage , wma support , replaceable battery , and especially that it wasn 't an apple product with their proprietary architecture .	1
since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work `` in 24 hours `` .	0
. itunes -- this is a love-hate relationship program ; . usually people with mac like this program than people with a pc , but depending on your computer expertise , this could be a difficult program to use , and it is required for an ipod .	1
after scouring the various boards i find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem .	0
we found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader , there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used .	0
this player is absolutely phenomenal , i haven 't had any problems , and if you 're worried you will have problems , i suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways . . . i find the touch pad very easy to use , and i 'm surprised so many people have had problems .	1
this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size ; . it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out .	1
if anyone is thinking of getting an ipod mini , forget it and go with this player .	1
my sd500 focuses flawlessly , does not `` whine `` during video , and my pictures are razor sharp .	1
it 's cheaper , holds more songs and is smaller .	1
the software included is an easy installation and you have the option of using the creative software , windows media player 10 , or simply windows explorer to move music back and forth between your zen touch .	1
the other pail i used started to smell after 2 weeks of use .	0
what disappoints me the most that a software like that is not cheap gets zero support form symantec , if you want support , they 'll charge you a fee ! .	0
i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful .	1
the creative zen micro , at first glance , is a dream come true for all mp3 and music lovers .	1
i had tried to uninstall norton internet security a few weeks ago , and it wouldn 't let me do that either .	0
it is a bit cumbersome , and i can 't get to the songs i want as quickly .	0
it 's shorter , sleeker , more compact and fits comfortably in my small hand than the ipod . . . my nokia cell phone towers over this bad boy ! .	1
- best in class sound	1
the software has n 't been a hassle for me at all .	1
1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone .	1
battery life is exceptional , lasting longer than the 8-10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market .	1
i forgot , the case does n 't fit .	0
for me , it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high-quality result .	1
the only thing i don 't like is the small size ( 8 meg ) memory card that comes with it .	0
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email .	1
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset .	1
this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly .	1
still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features ! .	1
2 . the scroll button is n 't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select .	0
i noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too .	1
at 128 the songs sound very good .	1
i 'd give it 4 . 5 stars if possible , but since 5 stars would be misleading , i give it 4 stars .	1
using the software itunes is relatively simple , you just plug the usb cable in , wait your machine to detect the ipod and voila , any songs listed in your itunes library will be transfer ed on over to the ipod .	1
i wanted this product because i didn 't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended .	1
as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale .	0
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website .	1
so far it has been very durable ( other than the little pads on the earbuds ) , but those aren 't really necessary as i find them comfortable on their own .	1
diaper champ is great .	1
when i went to put in the new sd card i looked at the lcd screen -- cracked -- and the fluid gave a jackson pollock type appearance to the screen , black and blue and purple blotches and streaks -- useless .	0
i have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd 's , after the frustration and aggravation of getting the player to do it 's job .	0
but this does work even if you turn off the lcd viewing -- great battery saver .	1
i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints .	1
i 'd recommend this is you want to wireless network your laptop , but if you want to wirelessly network a couple desktops together you might want to wait until linksys improves their desktop software/hardware .	0
on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm .	0
as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible .	1
i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets .	1
sound : this is where i love zen the most .	1
but this doesn 't make up for it 's innumerable other short-comings , the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with liveupdate .	0
2- it is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use .	0
do not buy any home version of norton anything .	0
so far ( 3 weeks ) , we 've had no problems with the diaper champ at all .	1
i purchased this camera before it went on sale , and while i wouldn 't have minded keeping the extra $ $ $ , it was definitely worth it .	1
essentially , the cd included with the package is , for the most part , worthless .	0
it wo n 't play 80 % of my movies , which are all store bough ten .	0
1 ) great audio quality overall .	1
this product is too fragile for normal use .	0
anything this phone does , it does perfectly .	1
i want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason .	1
their products have been great and have saved my bacon on numerous occasions .	1this is easy to work and easy to dispose of the dirty diapers .	1
i 'm giving this player cautious recommendation .	1
i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no vi sable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) .	1
buy this if you like mental challenges or trying how to pick locks .	0
operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i 'm no annie levitt 's , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store .	1
the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .	1
you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right .	1
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .	0
the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .	0
all in all , this is a great phone .	1
like other reviewers , installation was hell .	0
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n 't blind you when you stare too long .	1
had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches .	0
the movie mode is also working great .	1
this dvd play is basically junk .	0
it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual .	1
it 's the same body as the popular elp2 aps camera ( take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you 'll have an idea of the front profile ! . ) .	1
1 ) price / gb of storage	1
5- excelent software package .	1
bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .	1
this is a good deal for music and data storage .	1
the photostitch software is very cool if you want to do any 360 degree panorama shots .	1
i had a casio unit , which had given great service , and would have been happy to get another one , but was tempted by the ipod 's sleek design , storage capacity , connection options- - firewire and usb , and its integration with itunes .	1
less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer .	1
the program brings more problems than a virus , albeit not as major problems , just not what you expect for 70 bucks .	0
the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on/off button .	0
what a disappointment ! .	0
i 've had a lot of cameras , but this one is actually being used , and not stored in a desk : it 's all ways in my shiest pocket .	1
however since this router is backward compatible , that doesn 't pose a problem at all .	1
what i like the most : - small and solid feel .	1
battery life is ok .	1
why bother when it works perfectly with media player 10 ? .	1
but like i stated , its better then a trash can , but i 'm not sure if its better then the diaper genie .	1
and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey ! .	1
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it .	1
feels solid in hand .	1
the stand that comes with it is very useful to prop it up on the desk .	1
some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .	0
booting up my computer took forever ! . ! . ! .	0
although the sd500 takes great quality photos , the sensitivity of the lcd compromises the quality overall .	0
i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems .	1
versatile and stylish .	1
the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files .	1
again , this doesn 't affect regular mp3 files - just subscription drm-encoded files , like those from napster-to-go or yahoo music unlimited .	0
apart from speed , the signal is consistent and works without interruptions , etc .	1
i do not count this as a negative , however , because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you get this router is way too good to pass up ! . ! . ! .	1
travel with it without knowing you have it in your pocket	1
i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession -- great for action shots .	1
but with a low price , comes lower quality .	0
it is crystal clear .	1
while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece .	1
this doesn 't affect standard mp3 files - just subscription wma files .	0
second , it is incredibly easy to use .	1
i love all of the features , and presets as well .	1

after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .	0
simple and it works ! .	1
downside : it takes a long time to start up .	0
controls easy yo use and easy to get to .	1
1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .	0
this is the first phone i know of that has the large bright screen , infrared , bluetooth , usb connector and a speakerphone .	1
the only thing i do n 't like about this is the cover does suck .	0
there is absolutely nothing useful at the symantec/norton site .	0
to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .	1
they made the other end of the camera flat so you can put the camera upright on a flat surface if you don 't like to take the usual horizontal pictures using the self-timer .	1
another problem i had with this camera was the zoom function .	0
the catch is that , while it plays movies just fine , it has refused to read second discs with the movie `` extras `` on them on the two occasions when i tried to do that .	0
the powershot g3 is a great camera .	1
i especially like the more commonly used buttons , such as play , pause , and stop , to be larger and conveniently placed .	0
it 's not as stylized as a sony or samsung .	0
the included earphones are pretty good - my advice ? .	1
there was occasionally a lip-sync issue ( the lips were n 't moving in time to the dialog ) .	0
the karma doesn 't look as sexy but it 's interface is very efficiently designed .	0
i find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on .	0
i would have given this phone 5 stars if it wasn 't for the fact that i would rather use my 3330 to do all the most common things you do with a phone .	1
this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it .	1
it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .	0
it ain 't cutting edge ( no pun intended ) state of the art with all the latest bells & whistles & it definitely ain 't pretty .	0
otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; . shutter delay is n 't so bad either .	1
i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it & it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment .	0
for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised .	1
i was using a motorola t720i with verizon and i had alot of dropped calls and i had troubles syncing data .	0
i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down .	1
the wrt54g offers excellent security features and much more ( and easier ) configuration menu that i didn 't even need a manual to setup correctly .	1
i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended .	0
the linksys technical support site has nothing about configuring the router for use with a mac .	0
cuts are easy and smooth .	1
while i am not happy that a solid state device died after such a short period of time , my quick review of this product space did not yield any other brands that seem much better than linksys .	1
you have to purchase that separately for some outrageous cost .	0
sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening ! .	1
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .	1
i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3 . 5 ) , but unfortunately , i am returning it .	1
the voice recorder is a beautiful add-on ; . not even necessary , but just an example of why apple just wants your money and creative labs wants to make a better player .	1
with accessories , you can make the ipod into a digital recorder , broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology , and play it through your car speakers using either a cd adaptor or fm stereo broadcaster .	1
its quiet .	0
whatever . . . on to the negatives : -touchy about charging . . . you can damage the battery and seriously decrease it 's life if you don 't upgrade the firmware or dont ' heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side .	0
best in class .	1
smooth plunging ! . ( it did stick a bit so i sprayed it w/ lubricant .	1
enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n 't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .	0
i love the features on the ipod and the many things you can do with it .	1
get it , it 's woth every penny ! . ! .	1
everything else about the camera is great .	1
while i 'm not too keen on their customer service ( none of the products i have from creative have given me issues ) , i can definitely recommend the zen micro for the simple fact that it does exactly what it is supposed to do and more . . . without needing any of the extra hype except word of mouth .	1
this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .	1
the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing .	1
the zen micro ( mine 's black ) has a lot going for it .	1
very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .	1
the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad .	1
i have tried other pails , but none have compared positively to the champ .	1
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .	1
is it necessary to scan my ms money database when i close the program ? .	0
just don 't get drawn into t-mobile 's catchy rebate .	0
i guess the two antennae help with that besides making it look cooler .	1
this is my first mp3 player and i am so impressed with what such a small device can do .	1
overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned .	1
you also need to go in and manually remove many symantec files from the registry .	0
the best part of the firewall is the visual backtracking .	1
but about 25 % of dvd 's i 've played on it have a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventually the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments .	0
it was easy to assemble , and the diapers fit perfectly into the little nook before they make their way into the pail portion .	1
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons .	0
i am a big fan of itunes , simply because it is terribly fast and convenient - if you are buying the songs from the itunes site .	1
it worked from 12-26 to 1-9 at which time the picture failed completely ( see other negative reviews-my unit was n 't the only one this happened to . )	0
again , the headphone jack on this thing is garbage .	0
and , when you think about it , it 's insulting that norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops -- anyone who can provide proof of purchase , whether on the phone or online ( what if your computer is down ? . ) , should have equal priority .	0
having the digic ii chip helps a lot .	1
by the way , i use the norton 2003 corporate at work with absolutely no trouble .	1
i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at & # 38 ; . t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .	1
i got this for christmas , and it is a great gift .	1
t simply the best player on the market for a really low price , so why look anywhere else ? .	1
even though i have the parental controls off it constantly starts updating them then freezes my computer .	0
it is a multifunction phone , reception quality is better than the 610 .	1
downloads are a snap and quick .	1
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing .	1
you 'll do that because the keys are tightly packed in and your fingers will likely press two keys at once .	0
4- looks great .	1
and we still love it ! .	1
the touch pad does take a little getting used to .	0
good color and very little needed to correct photos on paint shop pro .	1
get great themes and wallpapers for this phone and many many polyphonic rings .	1
it fits comfortably in my shirt pocket and while very well-designed , doesn 't look to ostentatious while i 'm walking around with it .	1
3 ) joy stick for eazy navigation , 35mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff .	1
overall , a good buy for the price .	1
) the zen micro appears sturdy and well constructed , hefty , if you will , far better than many of its competitors . .	1
so reliability is the winner here for the ipod .	1
you need the software to actually transfer files	0
i 'd give it 5 stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes .	0
one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n 't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 .	0
i have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode , while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera , its quality easily surpasses that of my old hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe ( max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card ) .	1
8mb for a camera like this is a joke .	0
i 've searched the program and their online tech support ( worthless ) and have found no solutions .	0
for the price , it 's a very nice dvd player .	1
picture quality 's great for still and video with sound .	1
there were a few attractive features , such as the small size and the layout of the remote .	1
seems the `` program scan `` feature did not find the exe file for outlook ! .	0
sharper pictures .	1
multiple users on one machine never seemed to behave like you 'd expect .	0
i love the quality of the pictures .	1
not plug & play ; . relies on id3 ; . no fm or recording	0
the fact that has an open-source firmware makes it a great option in my opinion .	1
in addition , it only seems to work if you 're about five feet away from the player , although that may have been just the batteries that came with it .	0
the quality is superb .	1
the router has plenty of power for any type of bit or wood i need to cut , and the speed control knob is easy to get to .	1
for the most part this is a good dvd player .	1
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .	1
1 ) fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days )	0
my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .	1
i 'd say that this camera is perfect .	1
unfortunately , linksys does not write the best documentation .	0
the range is terrific , i am using this for my home and i was transferring at 50+mbs from my backyard .	1
sound quality : the ipod 's sound quality is pretty good .	1
with bluetooth off the phone last almost twice as long .	1
bottom line : if you value excellent sound quality and the ability to use music subscription services , and are willing to deal with the possibility ( not the certainty ) of setup gremlins , by all means get the zen micro .	1
the headphones are not very comfortable , but most people have a certain style they like so just go buy new ones or keep the ones you have .	0
i find the apex ad-2600 to be a great buy .	1
apple has definately fulfilled its reputation in making quality equipment , and surprisingly wasn 't as expensive as its reputation normally holds .	1
i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised .	1
in fact , it supports the new wpa encryption standard , which is way better than wep .	1
it sends discontinuous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment .	0
apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy .	0
two : it has a removeable/rechargeable battery , so you don 't have to send the thing in when the re ! .	1
this was an awesome player , before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks ) .	0
i 'm not sure whether this is related to the charge cycle of its li-ion battery , the better firmware , or a combination of both factors .	1
overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .	1
huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing .	1
the ipod package comes with everything you need , the ac adaptor , firewire cable ( quicker than usb , but slower than usb 2 which it also gives ) , those snazzy and power full headphones , and of course the player .	1
it 's a bit pricey to call home from other countries but the instant messaging to and from covered countries in europe are quite reasonable .	1
with one of the most intuitive user-interfaces around , seamless bluetooth sync with microsoft outlook , support for thousands of applications for the symbian platform which this phone runs on ( i own the ir remote , iq and a few others ) , the nokia 6600 is all of the above - one of the few phones from t-mobile that can claim such a distinction .	1
although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing .	0
the interface , while a bit confusing at first , is very easy to navigate after about 15 minutes .	1
feedback on creative 's product support is universally poor ; . this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products .	0
too bad the product is cumbersome and intertwined trying to do so much at one time .	0
the battery holds a charge for a very long time ( maybe 15 or so hours of use ) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with ipod use .	1
i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but on full size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .	1
five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums .	1
im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button ! .	1
the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .	0
the micro seemed like an ipod for less .	1
you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight camera shake is a problem to contend with .	0
the only other problem with this router that i have encountered is the plunge action will start to stick , then it needs to be cleaned and lubricated .	0
battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive	0
we constantly got `` windows virtual memory low `` error messages popping up foll wed by ridiculous slowdowns and/or crashes .	0
i have the black one and adore it .	1
i didnt have any installation problems ; . and the touch pad is fine , even if it is sort of inaccurate .	1
supporting an operating system , symbian os , you can download and run a lot of programs on this phone .	1
for last one month my rebate status showing me that my rebate is approved and check is delivered but still i am waiting for check .	0
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www . crazy cellphone . com	1
. images taken indoor were n 't so clear .	0
they take excellent macro shots as well .	1
in fact , i liked it so much after using it with my son who is now 2 years old , that i bought one for our new baby 's room .	1
the plug er gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess .	0
i loaded a lot of photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and , very importantly , the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous .	1
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had .	1
among my requirements for a phone were : good screen , decent camera , bluetooth , and gprs support .	1
) -can 't be left in the car . . . it immediately shuts down with an overheating error if left in a hot car for too long .	0
the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption .	1
the internet connection would go down every 5 mins when i used it with a p2p program called bit spirit .	0
the only problem i have with the buttons is that the power button and print/share button don 't have a nice click .	0
for purposes of clarity , here is my review from that product , edited to be appropriate for this product , since , for the most part , they share many of the same problems .	0
really like it , easy to use , great images , very intuitive , fits in my jacket pocket .	1
you actually can talk to a real person for support in under an hour ! . ) .	1
the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers .	1
while i was trying to play half life 2 it started popping up with `` alerts `` every twenty seconds ( literally ) , warning me my antivirus protection was off .	0
unfortunately , creative offered scant few pages of instruction , which meant that i was on own from the outset .	0
this fixes some glitches such as the player freezing .	0
when i opened the box , i was shocked by the size of this thing . . . it 's tiny ! .	1
there is no way you can talk with customer care about this .	0
	1
the micro has an impressive array of very nice features and a well designed user interface .	1
i like to take pictures when i go out at night and perhaps some people would complain that noise levels are high at higher iso 's but i don 't really care that much , i think it gives the pictures a certain real-life quality .	1
i almost always get a good strong signal , even in fairly remote areas here in the southwest .	1
i can go pretty far away from my router and still connect wirelessly .	1
fortunately for me , i have yet to have a single problem with this player .	1
in low light with flash i found it clear better then the sony p200 ( too much red , colours overall not as natural but fewer red-eyes ) .	1
i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera .	1
after repeal cleaning and re cleaning , it still stuck after using it for a little while .	0
ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n 't even gotten to all of them yet .	1
the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) .	0
i took my zen micro with me over the weekend , and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason : to keep the zen micro charged .	0
norton has been on a downhill slid recently with their products , but with this one , they have fallen off the cliff .	0
the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use .	1
canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .	1
don 't buy the diaper champ .	0
the image quality is excellent .	1
the hitachi m12v is a dream to work with , smooth starts , adjustable speeds , micro-adjustable depth , and plenty of power to spare .	1
most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy .	1
i am impressed with this camera inside and out .	1
when talking the voice is not very clear .	0
6 ) the phone is really wide , which seems to be a turnoff for many people , but the phone is actually easier to grip and feel more ergonomic .	1
the sound is very nice .	1
so , i 've had it for a month , and the headphone jack went out .	0
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in .	1
working for 10 hours with it on `` shuffle `` totally rocks ! . ! .	1
2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide-angle -- wc-e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured .	0
i think the os and controls are very well thought out and although i 'll admit i was a bit intimidated during my first few hours with the micro , the interface and controls became second nature after the first day or so .	1
the instructions that come with it do n 't explain how to make things simple .	0
there is not a word about satellite issues in either the user guide or the `` knowledge `` database at linksys . com , and first tech support person i spoke with kept me on the phone for an hour , then gave me a web site address to consult -- that turned out to be the one i 'd already found during a search of my own .	0
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .	0
2 ) nice features , like web browser , camera , video recorder , speaker phone ( very usefully ) , clear voice reception .	1
with the plunge lift all my bit changing has been done above the table , although i still have to reach below the table to operate the spindle lock ( and , of course , the speed and on/off controls ) .	0
purchased this router a few months back , no problems whatsoever .	1
the camera and video functionality is decent , i can 't see myself wasting my time with it , but some people will .	1
while they all seem to have their own positives and negatives , i picked the zen micro over the ipod mini , because i am not an apple person , never has been - i wanted something that is fully compatible with windows media player .	1
so much safer than the others that require a two handed operation ! .	1
moving on to sound department . . . it delivers ! .	1
i have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds , no big deal .	1
the achilles heel of this router is its inability to stream music , or copy large files over the local network .	0
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm .	1
tech support from apex is literally - nonexistent .	0
durability : not good . first problem , if you haven 't seen the news recently , the ipods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months .	0
screen review could be better .	0
as i said , i don 't regret the purchase at all .	1
i can use it as a modem for my computer , connect with clients and friends , the possibilities are endless .	1
the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .	1
it is small .	1
it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice .	1
- looks sleek , compact , has a radio .	1
the soft start is nice .	1
the moveable lcd screen is great .	1
the ear buds that come with it look cheap , but the sound quality is amazing .	1
3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing .	0
we tried it out christmas night and it worked great .	1
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer .	1
this is a great camera for you ! .	1
comes with a installation cd which instructs you step by step to setting up the router .	1
the menu pops up after 3 seconds the picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory .	0
this is a must have product for all new moms ! .	1
other than that this thing is great . . .	1
you 'll love it ! .	1
my other nit is that it didn 't include at least some kind of carrying case for everything .	0
applications : it has lots of applications and they work very well . . . when you eventually find where they are and they finally open .	1
other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips .	1
i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .	1
you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .	0
the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .	1
ultimately you will learn just how bad nokia is , and why their recent loss of market share is so utterly deserved .	0
getting files onto it is quick and painless .	1
i first used the router in the free hand mode and liked it a lot .	1
finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600 .	0
autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all .	1
ease of use/design : the ipod is a very easy to use mp3 player , and if you can 't figure this out , you shouldn 't even own one .	1
its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed & # 38 ; . phone lying by your pillow side .	1
anted to rate the router higher than 1 star , due to its security , easy of use , etc .	1
i highly recommend it if you are looking for a phone with great camera quality and/or lots of features you would find in a pda .	1
poor visibility on the keys .	0
it has many great features and very few bad ones .	1
i did not conduct a rigorous test , but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras , and the canon won hands down .	1
* scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models .	0
i decided to go with the diaper champ rather than the more popular diaper genie , because i didn 't like the idea of having to buy special bags .	1
this may be a really cool phone , but it 's not worth it with t-mobile .	1
the hitachi is made in malaya , and looked cheap compared with the makita , which is made in the usa .	1
the player 's mechanics are also flawed .	0
further , the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the ipod .	1
in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .	1
remote : you can stand it on end ( harder to lose ) , and it 's far better designed than the 1100s .	1
nice little phone . . . light compact . .	1
overall the phones fantastic , and i would have given it 5 stars , but its not perfect .	1
the two-times optical zoom operates smoothly and quietly , and lo and behold , a two-piece shutter-like cap automatically slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off .	1
since then , i have not found one major problem with it .	1
everything i wanted ! . the apple ipod has become one of the most sought-after electronic gadgets - and for good reason .	1
the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing ! .	1
stay away from this junk .	0
whether you are using disposable or cloth diapers , this is the truly the only diaper pail to get ! .	1
this is a great product ! .	1
if you have an older version of `` internet security `` installed , you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with systemworks install .	0
after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd 's are dirty .	0
excellent range of metering options as well .	1
some movies it played yesterday , it wo n 't play today .	0
i simply hate symantec . i swear , if i could have physically ripped that software out of my computer with my bare , bleeding hands , i would have .	0
in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders .	0
this one is really great .	1
- radio quality : weak reception	0
i imagine if i left my player untouched ( no backlight ) it could play for considerably more than 12 hours at a low volume level .	1
the more i use it and figure out how to do things , the more i like it .	1
3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws .	0
the new router came with an updated setup utility that makes getting the router installed a fairly straight forward process .	1
i bought this camera two days ago , and i 'm very pleased to say that it has been worth the money .	1
after two weeks the picture kept freezing .	0
the player kept displaying `` no disc `` , so i tried the disc in another machine and sure as @ # * ! .	0
when i finally got it working , it only worked properly for many a month .	0
record memos using the built in microphone .	1
controls are a bit awkward .	0
it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix .	1
4- my idea was that it was an all-in-one , and that theory -once again- proves wrong , this phone ex cells at nothing , less than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the `` other than phone `` functionalists , you 'll be disappointed . . . . if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine . . . . but don 't expect to get much done .	0
as the 6600 uses 900mhz , it operates in more countries than the 6620 .	1
the thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome ! .	1
i click pictures in jog format and because the phone has a bluetooth device i find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth .	1
this did n 't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .	1
3 ) the champ is odor free for at least 15 months .	1
i like the automatic key lock function .	1
the blue light also makes this player one of the most fashionable in the market also .	1
the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to .	1
the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .	1
the sd500 software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed .	1
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise .	1
definitely a great camera .	1
i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred .	1
each of the 4 lasted less than six months .	0
the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to .	0
the only con i can think of is the lack of a mega-pixel camera .	0
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .	0
i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy .	1
at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice .	0
i , as many others , have waited for many years for the convergence of price , features , size and ease of use to hit that happy center point .	1
and , with the ipods ' full volume up , all you have to do is adjust your receivers ' volume and your set , since the ipod itself acts as a strong amp lifer of its ' own .	1
the 6600 was the best phone i could find with these options that i could get with t-mobile .	1
software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n 't mind buying notmad .	0
settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints .	1
for a sleeker , smaller and more `` average `` mp3 player the nitrus is great but the ipod blows it out of the water - the interface is great and the design is wonderful .	1
i highly recommend this phone .	1
the file ripping/transfering software that comes with the player is easy to use .	1
this is a nice feature ( i . e . it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to `` easy listening `` rather than `` heavy metal `` - no problem .	1
1 no direct firewire to the camera .	0
i tried e-mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable .	0
even the `` shorter `` battery life , though , has not impaired my positive experience with the zen micro in any way .	0
all in all this is a 5 star piece of equipment .	1
i just bought this player today and i already love it .	1
also , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy .	1
the extra spare battery is just a neat bonus .	1
if you call apple and tell them your ipod has been damaged , they charge you roughly $ 105 . 50 per minute and blame you for `` abusing `` your ipod .	0
has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range .	1
both of them keep disconnecting on me and interruptions are 3 or 4 times per day at best .	0
there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient .	0
i bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and i absolutely love it ! .	1
the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .	0
it is a nice router in all ways but one .	1
1 it has all the features an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want .	1
don 't use them , so i delete them for addle space .	0
and so far , i 've been very pleased .	1
i have stored 40 audio cds and i still have close to 2 . 8 gb free .	1
the sound is great , the portability , etc . . . all the `` stuff `` you expect from a good mp-3 player , this zen micro has it .	1
as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand .	0
very good balance in the hands and lighter than most 3 1/4 hp models .	1
i tell you now , after lot of shooting in many different situations , this camera is amazing .	1
also , it was only $ 39 . 99 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player .	1
once you set it up , it 's great .	1
it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems , the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches .	0
overall i 'm incredibly impressed with my new zen touch .	1
i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not ( like my apartment ) .	1
i have no problems with the touch pad ( once the sensitivity is set to low ) and the interface is a breeze to use without even looking at the pdf manual .	1
about 10 % of the time it can 't find the device when i attach it to my pc .	0
there were many times when i clicked the automatic shutter and nothing happens .	0
i must say , this one is quite slow to open an application .	0
i 'll be getting a second one for my router table ! .	1
we empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it ! .	1
learning how to use it will not take very long .	1
awesome for the newbie , though i personally like to fasten every bolt myself .	1
the subscription files are still a little slower to transfer , but it 's only by about 10 % or so .	0
i have never had this problem with any other software on my computer .	0
first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .	1
you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division .	0
where close to 12 hours but at least it is replaceable ( and they included a second one free ) .	0
i am enjoying my phone a lot . . . .	1
no one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor . '	1
i purchased a jukebox , it got fried while being recharged , they asked for $ 20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for reaping the damned thing .	0
after getting used to the m12 all the rest seemed lacking .	1
i could take 1/2 `` passes and it still didn 't skip a beat .	1
another problem is that the latest 2 . 0 firmware upgrade moves you into windows media player 10 which seems to be very , very slow for downloads . charging [ -2 ]	0
but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive ! .	1
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them .	1
fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket .	1
the battery life can 't be very long ; . let 's not be greedy .	0
other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system .	0
i can keep one hand on my baby and dump the diaper at the same time , it is that simple .	1
the fact that this model would play jpeg slide shows was a big plus for me as a visual artist , and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting .	1
and also , since it is teri band and since it uses sim-card , you can just use it in europe and many other parts of the world , wherever gsm exists .	1
transferring music is a breeze . i don 't subscribe to music services , but as mentioned on other reviews , micro allows you to subscribe to services other than itunes .	1
you can `` disable `` some of the individual components , but don 't be fooled -- they 're still there and running .	0
even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback .	1
buttons do seem a little sticky tho . . and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem . .	0
for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .	1
the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine .	1
my only complaint and the reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the on-camera controls aren 't as intuitive as they should be .	0
also , diapers tend to stay in the middle , causing the pail to get backed up .	0
a larger memory card and extra battery are good things to buy .	0
i got a 1gb mmc upgrade for this phone and now i can :	1
if you experience problems with installation , you can visit symantec 's website , click the support tab , click the 'home or home office support ' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it .	0
it works great .	1
the good : small size ; . durable-seeming metal case ; . easy to use ; . visually distinctive ; . good picture quality ; . fast usb connection ; . mostly intuitive operation ; . really cool photostitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas .	1
additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screen saver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc . )	1
